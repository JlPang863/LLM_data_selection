## üéâüéâ News 
- [x] [2025.01.22] üëèüëè Accepted by **ICLR 2025**.
- [x] [2024.11.10] üì¢üì¢ Release the [curated dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jlpang888/cured_dataset_gpt_4o_mini).
- [x] [2024.10.08] üöÄüöÄ Release the code of **DS2**.

## Brief Introduction
This project is motivated by a phenomenon that the errors of LLM-generated raw rating scores are widespread and vary significantly across different LLMs. Then, we introduce DS2, a diversity-aware score curation method for data selection.

- **Prompt-based LLM Rating**: We generate an initial quality score for each data sample using advanced LLMs.
- **Curated Quality Score Generation**: This step corrects potential rating score errors from the previous step by leveraging the Score Transition Matrix to derive a curated quality score.
- **Long-tail Diversity Score Generation**: We score the diversity of each example by measuring the distance between feature embeddings, identifying samples that fall outside common clusters, which tend to be more distinct.
- **Final Data Selection**:  We prioritize data by first sorting based on the curated scores and then by the long-tail scores. This dual sorting strategy helps with removing poor-quality outliers while ensuring a diverse, high-quality dataset.

## Dataset preparation

<!-- This repository follows the codebase from [TULU](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct).  -->
One can download the evaluation/training data by

```bash
# eval data
bash model_finetune/scripts/prepare_eval_data.sh

# train data 
bash model_finetune/scripts/prepare_train_data.sh
```


## Environment Setup
To run training, evaluation, or inference for finetuned models, you need to install the required packages by running the following command (after installing pytorch):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


----- 
## üöÄüöÄ Get Started

### üß© Step 1. LLM-prompt-based rating

In this project, we use three labeling models to generate rating scores, including GPT-4o-mini, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct.  In particular, we can use the GPT API call to generate the model answers by executing the code located in the `LLM_scoring` path: 
```
cd LLM_scoring && bash labeling_datasets_api.sh
``` 
For open-source models such as LLaMA and Mistral, you can submit the jobs via launcher to the cluster, i.e., 
```
cd LLM_scoring && launcher run job_labeling.yaml
``` 
or generate scores locally using 
```
cd LLM_scoring && bash scoring_datasets_local.sh
```


---

### üß© Step 2. Score curation
Th score curation codebase is from [Docta](https://github.com/Docta-ai/docta) in the `./score_curation` path. You can execute the score curation by running
```
cd score_curation && bash diagnose_tulu.sh
```
The corresponding curation report files could be found in the path `./score_curation/results`.


---

### üß© Step 3. Data selection
Given the existing score curation reports, you can directly use the following jupyter notebooks to do data selection including all baselines: `data_gen_baselines_all.ipynb`. The generated subsets can be further used for LLM instruction tuning. Other selected datasets used for ablation study can be also generated from the following jupyter notebooks located in the `./score_curation` path: `data_gen_score_curation.ipynb` and `data_gen_data_scale.ipynb`. In particular, we use `data_gen_score_curation.ipynb` to generate subsets after curating machine-generated raw scores.


We implement nine baselines consists of Random, Perplexity, KNN, [LESS](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/LESS), Completion_length, Full data, [Alpagasus](https://github.com/Lichang-Chen/AlpaGasus/tree/main) (label-filtered), [DEITA](https://github.com/hkust-nlp/deita) (diversity-filtered), Ours w/o. curation and Ours.


---
### üß© Step 4. Finetune & Evaluation
Given the selected subsets in the path `model_finetune/selected_data/`, you can use the code base from [TULU](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct) to finetune base models (Mistral or LLaMA) and then do evaluation.
In particular, you can submit the jobs via launcher under the path `model_finetune/`. For example, you can submit the job by running the code 
```
cd model_finetune/ && launcher run job_pipeline_all.yaml
```


Futhermore, we can also execute the code locally, e.g.,  
```
cd model_finetune/ && bash run_pipeline_all.sh
```

One can present the final result by running 
```
python model_finetune/read_results.py
```

------

## Final results 
The final results of LLM judging compared with human-annotated dataset LIMA can be found in `lima_compare_plot.ipynb`. Moreover, for the tabular results, you can check the `reading_results.ipynb` jupyter notebook.
